# Meta Ads – Ad Set Health Dashboard

The **Ad Set Health Dashboard** is a diagnostic web tool designed to evaluate the performance of Meta (Facebook) Ad Sets. It provides a quick overview of campaign health by analyzing key advertising metrics such as **Cost per Result**, **Reach**, **Impressions**, **Link Clicks**, and overall **Health Scores**.

Users can upload their ad set data through an **`.xlsx` file** exported directly from **Meta Ads Manager**. Once uploaded, the dashboard automatically calculates and displays key performance insights, including:

- ✅ **Ad Sets Health Score**
- 💰 **Average Cost per Result**
- ⚠️ **Ad Sets Requiring Action**
- 📊 **Individual Ad Set Health Scores** *(Excellent, Good, Review, Urgent)*

This tool is ideal for **advertisers**, **marketing analysts**, and **media buyers** who want to quickly identify underperforming ad sets, optimize campaigns, and track results with clear, data-driven visuals.
