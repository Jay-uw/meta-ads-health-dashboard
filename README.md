### 💬 Health Score Explanation:
The health score is based on two main factors:

Cost per Result (CPR) → 60% of the score

Results achieved → 40% of the score

In simple terms, the system prioritizes keeping a low CPR over getting a higher number of results.
So even if a campaign performs well in results, if its cost per result is high, its overall health score will go down.
